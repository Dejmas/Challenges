# Challenges

Algorithms are Awesome! In this repository is a collection of my favorite algorithm. 

## Application

I will add algorithm and also some problem which can be solved by algorithm or techique. Interesting part is to read a problem and to figure out how algorithm can be used to solve this problem.

For instance, the problem [CSES Task Assignment](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2129) can be solved by Min Cost Max Flow algorithm.
